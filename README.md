Snake Game


This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer, but avoid hitting the walls or yourself!

Features

    Food for the snake to eat and grow longer.
    A scoreboard to track how many foods the snake has eaten.
    Game over detection when the snake hits the wall or itself.

How to Play

    Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
    Eat the pink food that appears randomly on the screen to grow longer.
    Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
    Try to score as high as possible.
